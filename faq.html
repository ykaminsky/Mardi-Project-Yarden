    <div class="title">
        <p>We know what you wanna ask !</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">How is the City government involved?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>City governments are not involved in coordinating Mardi Gras parades. The governments issue parade permits,
            but that is the extent of their involvement. Krewes independently schedule and coordinate their own parades.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Are Carnival and Mardi Gras the same thing?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Technically, "Carnival" refers to the period of feasting and fun that begins on January 6 (see question
            below) and ends on Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), the final day of revelry before Ash Wednesday when Lent begins.
            It is also common for
            people to refer to the entire season as Mardi Gras and, for clarity, to call Fat Tuesday "Mardi Gras Day."
            Locals tend to call the season "Carnival" and, to us, the last two weekends leading up to Tuesday are"Mardi
            Gras."</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">What is Twelfth Night?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Twelfth Night (aka, Twelfth Night, the Feast of the Epiphany and Three Kings' Day) is celebrated on January
            6th in New Orleans and is the official start of Mardi Gras every year. While the date of Fat Tuesday
            changes, Twelfth Night does not. According to Wikipedia, different traditions mark the date of Twelfth Night
            as either January 5 or January 6 (it depends on whether they start counting the twelve days on December 25
            or 26)</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">When was the first Mardi Gras?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The first Mardi Gras parade was held in New Orleans on Feb. 24, 1857 by the Krewe of Comus. They began the
            tradition of presenting a parade with floats and following it with a ball for the krewe and their guests.
        </p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">How long have "throws" been around?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The tradition of float riders throwing trinkets to the crowds began in the 1870s, and continues today.
            Typical throws include beads, cups, doubloons and stuffed animals. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">Do I need tickets?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>There is no need for tickets to see a parade...all of them are FREE!! That is why it is called "The Greatest
            Free Show on Earth!". You only get tickets if you want to sit down on stands as the parades pass. </p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion"> How is a king chosen?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>The method of selecting a king varies from krewe to krewe. Some krewes hold random drawings, while others
            invite a celebrity guest to be their king. Rex, the King of Carnival, is chosen by the School of Design, who
            sponsors the Rex parade. His identity is revealed the day before the parade.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="accordion">How does Mardi Gras benefit the New Orleans economy?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Economic impact reports indicate that Mardi Gras generates over $1 billion in annual spending.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">Why are masks worn?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>By law, float riders must always have a mask on. On Fat Tuesday, masking is legal for everyone else, and the
            elaborate masks that some wear add to the fun.</p>
    </div>
    <button class="accordion">What is the significance of the Mardi Gras colors, and where did they come from?</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Rex, the King of Carnival, selected the Mardi Gras colors and assigned meaning to them in 1892. Purple stands
            for justice, green for faith, and gold for power. </p>
