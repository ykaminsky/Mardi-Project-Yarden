        <h1 class="aboutheader">So what's Mardi Gras ?</h1>
        <img src="Images/Mardi_Gras_Parade,_New_Orleans,_Louisiana_(LOC).jpg" class="clown" alt="">
        <p class="aboutparagraph">The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New
            Orleans. Celebrations are
            concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start
            of lent in
            the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days
            have
            several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
            Gras season. In
            the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and
            balls (some
            of them masquerade balls).

            The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade
            schedule and route
            each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights
            of Momus and
            the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern "super krewes" are well known for holding large parades and events
            (often featuring
            celebrity guests), such as the Krewe of Endymion, the Krewe of Bacchus, as well as the Zulu Social Aid &
            Pleasure Club—a
            predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most
            common throws are
            strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic "throw cups", Moon Pies, and small
            inexpensive toys.
            Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year.

            While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street, major parades originate in
            the Uptown and
            Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the
            French
            Quarter. Walking parades - most notably the Krewe du Vieux and Chewbacchus - also take place downtown in the
            Faubourg
            Marigny and French Quarter in the weekends preceding Mardi Gras Day. Mardi Gras Day traditionally concludes
            with the
            "Meeting of the Courts" between Rex and Comus.

        <h1 class="aboutheader">Get to know our traditional colors</h1>
        <img src="Images/colors.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="aboutparagraph">The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green,
            and gold. The colors were first
            specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872,
            suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were
            chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed
            to any true symbolism.

            Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory that the
            colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have
            been to create a tricolor to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while
            white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a
            flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that metals
            (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and
            that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.

            Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats themed
            around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order
            symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and
            gold, in that order—even though this order technically violates the rule of tincture.

        <h1 class="aboutheader">Our dear mayor LaToya Cantrell</h1>
        <img src="Images/LaToya.jpg" alt="">
        <p class="aboutparagraph">
            LaToya Cantrell (née Wilder; born April 3, 1972) is an American politician serving as the Mayor of New
            Orleans,
            Louisiana since May 7, 2018. A Democrat, Cantrell is the first woman to hold the office. Before becoming
            mayor, Cantrell
            represented District B on the New Orleans City Council from 2012–2018.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="aboutparagraph">Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first woman to hold the position
            in the city's history. Once
            in office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with the goal of creating a strategic plan to
            address families in crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence Reduction Council, tasked with
            finding solutions to violent crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected within the city
            for city use, Cantrell has
            focused on her #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public transportation, public parks,
            and green
            spaces. As part of that initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a lawsuit against four
            opioid
            manufacturers and distributors.

            During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with
            Governor John
            Bel Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement secured $50 million in upfront funding for
            the city's
            infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring revenue for the city. Following the approval
            of the
            Fair Share Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals Cantrell and the City Council put on
            the ballot
            in the 2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale and a tax on short-term rental
            properties, as
            well the establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans Home Rule Charter.
